# Lecture 13: Persistance

Lecture 13 begins with a brief demonstration of a UITextField to demonstrate the principles that were outlined in theory at the end of Lecture 12.

We then move onto our next main topic, Persistance. There are a wide variety of ways to persist data in iOS, so we'll be covering them at varying levels of depth. Here we go!

Methods of Persistance we cover:

1. UserDefaults
2. Archiving
3. File System
4. Core Data (Briefly)
5. Cloud Kit (Briefly)
6. UIDocuments
