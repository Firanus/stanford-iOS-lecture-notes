# Developing iOS 11 Apps with Swift - Lecture Notes

This repository compiles notes made on the lectures given as a part of the freely available Stanford course ['Developing iOS 11 apps with Swift'](https://itunes.apple.com/us/course/developing-ios-11-apps-with-swift/id1309275316). They will hopefully serve as an aid to individuals taking the course, but are not intended to replace the lectures themselves. In particular, any instances of live coding in the course have not been replicated here.
