# Lecture 8 - Animation

In this lecture we will be continuing to cover animation, which we briefly began last lecture. We'll be covering three main topics:

* UIView Property Animations
* Total UIView Animations
* Dymanic Animations

We'll then go on to animate the playing card example Paul whipped up in lectures 5 and 6. This hasn't been replicated as we'll get the chance to implement all this behaviour ourselves in the 4th programming exercise.
