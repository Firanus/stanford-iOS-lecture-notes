# Lecture 1

Lecture begins with an overview of what the remainder of the course will cover. After this, we begin building an IOS app called [concentration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_(game)).

The topics covered by this lecture thereafter are, very briefly:
* Using the interface builder to design an app.
* Connecting the UI to the code.
* Basic swift coding and functions.

Mostly, the principles are demonstrated using live code, so they are best reviewed by following along and/or coding the app oneself. See [this release](https://github.com/Firanus/ios-stanford-concentration/releases/tag/1.0) for a copy of the code.
