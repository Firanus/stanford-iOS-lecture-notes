# Lecture 3: The Swift Programming Language

This lecture we'll be looking mostly at how to use the Swift programming language. However, we begin with a brief description of how to make the UI automatically handle rotation and different screen sizes. This will be covered in much more depth in a later lecture.

Note also that many of the elements of this lecture were accompanied by changes to the Concentration app. Those changes have been made in [this release](https://github.com/Firanus/ios-stanford-concentration/releases/tag/2.0) of the project.
