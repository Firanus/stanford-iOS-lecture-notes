# Lecture 11: Drag and Drop, UITableView and UICollectionView

In this lecture we'll be looking at 2 more important topics, Drag and Drop and Views for displaying arbitrary amounts of data.

**Drag and Drop** will let us look at how we transfer information around and between apps using iOS 11's new multitasking API. 

We then look at **UITableView and UICollectionView**, two subclasses of UIScrollView designed to handle unbounded amounts of information. They have very similar APIs, so we will tackle them simultaneously.

We end the lecture by implementing a simple table view on the master pane of a split view.
