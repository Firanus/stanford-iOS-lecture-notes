# Lecture 10: Multithreading and Autolayout

In this lecture we'll be covering multithreading and autolayout, both vital topics in iOS.

In **Multithreading**, we cover how we execute tasks off of the main thread. While there are a number of reasons to do this, we consider the very common case of not wanting to block the UI of your app because you are undertaking a complicated task.

We then take a look at Autolayout in a little more depth. As well as briefly reviewing the work we've done so far on Autolayout, we also introduce the topic of SizeClasses, and how they can help us conditionally change the layout of our application.
