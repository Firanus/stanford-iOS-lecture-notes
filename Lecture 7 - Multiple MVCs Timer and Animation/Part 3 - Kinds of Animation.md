# Lecture 7, Part 3 - Kinds of Animation:

There are several kinds of animation:

* **Animating UI View Properties** - Changing things like the frame and transparency. This is the most common kind  of animation
* **Animating Controller Transitions** - when transitioning from one view to another, e.g. by putting another card on the stack. We will not be covering that in the course
* **Core Animation** - Underlying powerful animation framework. Beyond the scope of this course.
* **OpenGL and Metal** - 3D animation. Sadly, also beyond the scope of this animation.
* **Sprite Kit** - "2.5D" Animation. Overlapping images moving around on top of one another, e.g. like Mario Bros.
* **Dynamic Animation** - Physics based animation. This, we actually will cover!
