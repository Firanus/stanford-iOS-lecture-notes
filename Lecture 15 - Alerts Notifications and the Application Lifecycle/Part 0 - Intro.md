# Lecture 15: Alerts, Notification and the Application Lifecycle

In this lecture, we'll be looking at 3 distinct topics.

**Alerts** and Action Sheets are the names given to the View Controllers that are used to take over the screen in extraordinary events. They can also be used to provide the user with a branching decision in the app's UI. After an overview, we'll demonstrate their use in the EmojiArt application by reporting badly dropped background images.

**Notifications** (and KVO) are simple messages we use to tell the user what is going on. For instance, keyboard appeared, Document state changed, or User Font Size changed. We'll also demonstrate their use in the EmojiArt application by using them to track changes.

**The Application Lifecycle**. We've already looked at the View Controller lifecycle. This week, we'll also learn about the lifecycle of the application itself, and learn what all that code in `AppDelegate` is about.
