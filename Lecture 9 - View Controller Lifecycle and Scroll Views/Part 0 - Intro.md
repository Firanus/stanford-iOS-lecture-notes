# Lecture 9: The View Controller Lifecycle and Scroll Views

In this lecture, we'll be focusing on two main topics:

* The View Controller Lifecycle - the various stages of the controller's lifecycle and the hooks you can use to inject your own code into it.
* Scroll Views - A UIView that lets you scroll around and zoom into other UIViews.
