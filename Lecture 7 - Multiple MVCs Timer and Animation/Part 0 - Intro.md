# Lecture 7: Multiple MVCs, Timer and Animation

In this lecture we'll be looking at 3 main topics:
* **Multiple MVCs** - We'll look at ways of putting MVC systems together to make more powerful apps. We'll also demonstrate this by adding a theme loader to our Concentration app. As my version of the app already has a theme changer, I will edit it to ensure it follows the functionality.
* `Timer` - We'll also take a look at the Timer class, which we can use to keep track of times.
* **Animation** - Finally, we'll start looking at animation. This topic will overrun this lecture and continue into the next one.
